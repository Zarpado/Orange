# Orange - An upcoming remake of the famous HCF plugin, Mango. 

This is Orange.  An upcoming HCF plugin for 1.7. I have used mango in the past and realized that many things are wrong with it.  It has also been abandoned by the author, and the author is banned from spigotmc.  So, I have decided to remake it from scratch, in attempt to fix all bugs, and make it more efficient along the way. When complete, I will submit this as a premium resource on spigot.  

Progress will be updated daily with new commits. 
Projected finish date: Around early December 2017
Profected final price: $15
